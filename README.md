# cardano-wallet-connector

I want to create a basic html page that integrates cardano foundation wallet connector to connect to CIP-30 cardano wallets and to have a user whos viewing the webpage to connect to their web browser callet such as Eternl and to build a transaction using Emurgo serialization lib pure javascript with a specified amount of 30ADA, then have the user sign the transaction using their wallet and submit the transaction to their wallet to a wallet address specified by me, but you can use a placeholder for now.
